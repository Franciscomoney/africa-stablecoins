Sovereign Liquidity: Analyzing On-Chain Local Currency Velocity as a 
Precursor to Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization in Sub-Saharan Africa

The adoption of blockchain technology in Sub-Saharan Africa is frequently characterized by 
dollarization strategies intended to mitigate local currency volatility. However, the emergence of 
local-currency stablecoins presents a novel pathway for sovereign digital liquidity that may facilitate 
genuine economic circularity rather than capital flight. This study investigates the extent to which 
transactional velocity and holder distribution of local-currency stablecoins indicate retail market 
readiness for fractionalized Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, distinguishing genuine payment 
utility from speculative hedging. Utilizing a comparative on-chain forensic analysis, we extracted 
and parsed transaction logs from the Celo and Base blockchains to measure velocity, wallet 
concentration, and swap efficiency for assets including cNGN (Nigerian Naira) and cKES (Kenyan 
Shilling) against USD-pegged benchmarks. Results demonstrate a significant divergence in 
behavioral patterns; local stablecoins exhibited a "High-Velocity, Low-Value" profile with median 
transaction sizes as low as $2.55, consistent with micro-retail commercial activity. Conversely, 
USD-pegged assets displayed "Low-Velocity, High-Value" patterns indicative of savings and 
institutional capital preservation. These findings suggest that the digital infrastructure for African 
capital markets is currently active for payments and ready for tokenized financial products, provided 
they are structured for high-volume retail participation with low entry barriers rather than 
institutional investment.
